**Zerodha Clone : Trading Platform**

This project is a full-stack clone of the Zerodha trading platform, built to simulate a real-world stock dashboard experience. It features user authentication, dynamic holdings display, equity summaries, and buy functionality. The frontend is built with React.js, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. API testing was performed using Thunder Client, and JWT-based authentication ensures secure access.

**Please Note :** The server may take 50 seconds or more to start, especially on free hosting platforms like Render or when waking from cold start. This is expected behavior. Once the server is active, all API routes will respond normally.
